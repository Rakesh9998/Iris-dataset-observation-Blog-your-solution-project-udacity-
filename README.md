# Iris-dataset-observation-Blog-your-solution-project-udacity

This project is about analysing the Iris dataset .

# Libraries Used:

numpy
pandas
seaborn
matplotlib.pyplot
statsmodels
sklearn

# Motivation for choosing this dataset
Very straight forward 150 row and 4/5 column dataset containing measurements of three types of iris flowers. The iris dataset is a great binary classification problem to start with.

# Files in the repository

Iris_project.ipynb - It contains the code of visulization and machine learning
iris.csv - It is the dataset that I have used in my project

# Summary of the results

if(petal_length<2), then it is setosta if(petal_length<5 and petal_width<1.75), then it is versicolor else , it is verginica

We can separate flowers from others by comparing petal_length and petal_width features.

We can choose KNN as machine learning model as accuracy is about 98%
